# üîç Conversational Research Assistant

A powerful, stateful AI assistant that combines conversation memory, web search, and generative AI to provide informed, source-attributed responses to complex research questions.



## ‚ú® Features

- **üß† Conversation Memory** - Maintains natural context across multiple interactions
- **üíæ Knowledge Retention** - Stores and recalls past Q&A pairs using vector embeddings
- **üåê Web Research** - Integrates Tavily search API for real-time information retrieval  
- **üìù Structured Responses** - Generates clear, organized answers with proper source attribution
- **‚è±Ô∏è Timeout Handling** - Automatically clears stale conversations for optimal performance
- **üîÑ Follow-up Capability** - Understands context from previous questions

## üß© Key Components

### 1. Vector Database (Chroma)
- Stores conversation history as semantic vector embeddings
- Enables high-quality retrieval through past interactions
- Persists between sessions for continuous knowledge building
- Configurable for development or production environments

### 2. Google Generative AI
- **Embeddings**: `models/embedding-001` for high-quality vector representations
- **Chat Model**: `gemini-1.5-flash` for fast, coherent response generation
- Handles nuanced understanding and natural language generation

### 3. Tavily Search Integration
- Real-time web search capabilities with broad coverage
- Returns content with complete source attribution
- Configurable number of results per query (default: top 3)
- Provides up-to-date information beyond model training data

### 4. LangGraph Workflow Orchestration
- Coordinates the multi-step research process
- Maintains conversation state across interactions
- Handles error cases gracefully with fallback mechanisms
- Enables complex reasoning chains for better answers

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Google API key
- Tavily API key

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tanush1852/Search_Engine.git

# Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```ini
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
```

## üöÄ Running the Assistant

### Option 1: Streamlit Web Interface

For an interactive web-based interface:

```bash
streamlit run research_streamlit.py
```

This launches a user-friendly web app where you can interact with the research assistant through your browser.

### Option 2: Python Script

For programmatic usage or integration into other applications:

```bash
python research_system.py
```

#### Example Code Usage

```python
from research_assistant import agent_executor

# First query
result1 = agent_executor.invoke({"user_input": "why is obesity increasing worldwide?"})
print(result1["output"])

# Follow-up query (maintains context)
result2 = agent_executor.invoke({"user_input": "what are the main contributing factors?"})
print(result2["output"])

# Another follow-up
result3 = agent_executor.invoke({"user_input": "which countries are most affected?"})
print(result3["output"])
```

## üìä Example Output

```
QUERY: "Why is obesity increasing worldwide?"

RESPONSE:
‚Ä¢ Global obesity rates have nearly tripled since 1975, with over 650 million adults classified as obese as of 2022 (Source 1)

‚Ä¢ Key factors driving this increase include:
  - Increased consumption of energy-dense foods high in fat and sugars
  - Decreased physical activity due to sedentary work, changing transportation modes, and urbanization
  - Economic development and food system changes favoring processed foods (Source 2)

‚Ä¢ Obesity is no longer just a high-income country problem, with rapid increases now occurring in low- and middle-income countries (Source 3)

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Options

### Configuration Variables

Adjust these variables in `config.py` to customize behavior:

```python
# Conversation settings
CONVERSATION_TIMEOUT = 300  # Seconds until conversation is considered stale
MAX_HISTORY = 10            # Maximum number of previous exchanges to consider
SEARCH_RESULTS = 3          # Number of web search results to retrieve
DEVELOPMENT_MODE = True     # Clear DB on startup when True
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| API Authentication Errors | Verify API keys in `.env` file are correct and have necessary permissions |
| Chroma DB Locking | Delete the `chroma_db` directory manually if application crashes unexpectedly |
| Rate Limit Errors | Add delay between queries or upgrade API tier if hitting service limits |
| Memory Consumption | Reduce `MAX_HISTORY` if application uses too much RAM |

### Enabling Debug Logging

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
